        <span class="text-[30px]">Processing Time</span>
        <span>
          Please allow 1-2 business days for your order to be processed for shipping. During holidays, orders may experience processing delays.
        </span>
    
        <span>
          If incorrect information is provided, we will not be able to process your order due to inaccurate or incomplete payment information or incorrect address information. Processing your order may be delayed by an additional 3-5 business days if incorrect information is provided.
        </span>
    
        <span>
          ***(Note: All shipping addresses are verified through the USPS. If you are unsure of your shipping address, please check USPS.com. This does not apply to international orders.)
        </span>
    
        <span>
          We ship Monday through Friday, excluding weekends and U.S. holidays.
        </span>

        </span>
    
        <span>
          **MeltDrops is NOT responsible if the package is not delivered within the guaranteed shipping times, as it takes 1-2 business days to process the order, and we cannot be held responsible for USPS guarantees.
        </span>
    
        <span class="text-[30px]">Domestic Delivery Time - Standard Shipping:</span>
        <span>
          Transit time depends on the shipping method selected. Please note that transit time does not include weekends or holidays. All delivery times are estimated. MeltDrops is not responsible for delivery delays due to events beyond our control, including material shortages, labor strikes, transportation failures, or acts of nature.
        </span>
    
        <span class="text-[30px]">Rejected, Lost, Stolen, or Delayed Packages</span>
        <span>
          In the event of a rejected package, the shipping and handling cost will be charged to the payment method selected during checkout and deducted from any refund. For rejected products, a refund will not be initiated until the product is received and reviewed by the MeltDrops team.
        </span>
    
        <span>
          United Parcel Service (UPS) is the primary delivery service used. We cannot guarantee the replacement of lost or stolen packages shipped via UPS. In case of delays or any issue with your delivery, please contact us. MeltDrops is not responsible for lost, stolen, or delayed packages.
        </span>
    
        <span>
          ***(Note: In rare cases, international shipping to some countries may take 4 to 6 weeks. In severe cases, 8 to 12 weeks. MeltDrops is not responsible for any delays caused by the destination country's customs clearance processes. Shipping to certain countries may require additional shipping fees due to the geographical location.)
        </span>
    
        <span class="text-[30px]">Order Cancellation</span>
        <span>
          Due to high order volumes, a customer's order goes directly to our fulfillment center for processing. If the customer contacts us within 24 hours of purchase, they may cancel their order. If the customer contacts us after 24 hours of purchase, they will not be able to cancel their order. If your order has already been processed or shipped, we cannot cancel the order. Customers must refuse the package and promptly notify us of the date it was refused or return the package with a valid tracking number and notify us with said tracking number so we can verify. Once we receive the package back at our warehouse and review it, we can issue a refund.
        </span>
    
        <span class="text-[30px]">Incorrect Address Disclaimer</span>
        <span>
          It is the buyer's responsibility to ensure they enter the correct address. We cannot guarantee address changes due to strict shipping schedules. Please double-check the address you are entering, as we WILL NOT be responsible for packages shipped to an incorrect address entered by the buyer. If your order has already been processed or shipped, we cannot change the address, and the only thing we can do is wait to see if the package is returned. In that case, we can offer you a reshipment or a refund.
        </span>
    
        <span class="text-[30px]">Item Delivery</span>
        <span>
          In the event that a customer's tracking number indicates that delivery was made to the customer's address, MeltDrops does not offer refunds if the item is claimed to have not been delivered. If an item is not received when the tracking information confirms delivery, please contact the designated shipping company, USPS, for assistance.
        </span>
    
        <span class="text-[30px]">Returns</span>
        <span>
          To receive a full refund for your bottles, you must return all bottles, whether empty, full, or partially full (including any “extra” or “free” bottles as part of your order) to our fulfillment center at the address listed below within sixty (150) days of the date you originally ordered the product, along with a written or printed note inside the package with the following information clearly written:
        </span>
    
        <span>Your Order ID (Found on your receipt)</span>
        <span>
          Your Full Name and Complete Address where the shipment was received Your Email Address and Phone Number Your original packaging receipt (if available)
        </span>
        <span>
          ***(NOTE: Failure to return all bottles will result in a partial refund.)***
        </span>
    
        <span>
          For your full refund to be processed, the product must arrive at our fulfillment facility within sixty (150) days of the original purchase date. Failure to include all bottles purchased, whether empty, full, or partially full (including any “extra,” “free,” or “gifted” bottles), or failure to clearly write your order details as specified above in a way that a member of our fulfillment staff can read and clearly assign your return, will result in our inability to refund you. You are responsible for the return shipping cost. Once our fulfillment center has received the package and transmitted the correct information, a refund will be issued. Your refund will be credited to your bank account and may take 3 to 5 business days to appear on your statement, depending on the speed of the processing bank.
        </span>
    
        <span>
          All returns must be shipped via USPS to the following address:
        </span>
    
        <span>MeltDrops</span>
    
        <span>
          You must provide a tracking number for your return. Failure to provide a tracking number may delay the review of your return.
